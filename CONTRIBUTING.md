# Contributing to bysyscall

We welcome your contributions! There are multiple ways to contribute.

## Opening issues

For bugs or enhancement requests, please file a GitHub issue unless it's
security related. When filing a bug remember that the better written the bug is,
the more likely it is to be fixed. If you think you've found a security
vulnerability, do not raise a GitHub issue and follow the instructions in our
[security policy](./SECURITY.md).

## Contributing code

We welcome your code contributions. Before submitting code via a pull request,
you will need to have signed the [Oracle Contributor Agreement][OCA] (OCA) and
your commits need to include the following line using the name and e-mail
address you used to sign the OCA:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>
```

This can be automatically added to pull requests by committing with `--sign-off`
or `-s`, e.g.

```text
git commit --signoff
```

Only pull requests from committers that can be verified as having signed the OCA
can be accepted.

## Pull request process

1. Ensure there is an issue created to track and discuss the fix or enhancement
   you intend to submit.
1. Fork this repository.
1. Create a branch in your fork to implement the changes. We recommend using
   the issue number as part of your branch name, e.g. `1234-fixes`.
1. Ensure that any documentation is updated with the changes that are required
   by your change.
1. Ensure that any samples are updated if the base image has been changed.
1. Submit the pull request. *Do not leave the pull request blank*. Explain exactly
   what your changes are meant to do and provide simple steps on how to validate.
   your changes. Ensure that you reference the issue you created as well.
1. We will assign the pull request to 2-3 people for review before it is merged.

## Technical guide to contribution

The architecture used is

- a core program, src/bysyscall.c that loads src/bysyscall.bpf.c
  BPF programs and pins them to /sys/fs/bpf/bysyscall.
- a library, libbysyscall which provides override functions for system
  call wrappers like getpid etc.

Adding a new wrapper involves adding it to `FNS()` list in src/libbysyscall.c
and adding the function itself to src/libbysyscall.c.  As well as adding
the `function()`, add `__wrap_function()` since the latter is needed
for dynamic linking; `__wrap_function()` should simply call `function()`.

Also add tests to tests/ to check your syscall wrapper override works and
matches the results from the syscall itself, and verify no regressions
are introduced.
